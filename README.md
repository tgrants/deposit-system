# deposit-system

Software for a deposit bin prototype, created as part of the 'Introduction to Business' course (VadZB019).

## Contents

Main contents:

- `controller`: Barcode scanner and main controller for the deposit bin
- `driver`: Arduino controller for the physical components
- `mocking`: Script that mocks the driver for development purposes

## Setup

For a general guide on how to set up the environment see [`setup.md`](docs/setup.md).
To set up the controller, see [`controller/README.md`](controller/README.md).

For development purposes, you probably want to [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) the physical components.
To set up the mock driver, see [`mocking/README.md`](mocking/README.md).
